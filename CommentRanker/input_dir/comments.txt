112 It was a beautiful service.
113 Carter, if he could, would take a knee👏
114 @alphaeagle1776 that moment when you think kavanaugh is innocent until proven guilty but for democrats it’s the other way around.
115 Look @michaelrapaport!! @realdonaldtrump had his hand on his chest. I like everything you do except when you try to make the president look bad.

133 Mr. TrampIt does not matter to you what history to judge about you?Nations are waiting for world peace and love.Mohammad from Iran
134 This funeral has been the epitome of class and diginity. The reading by his son was almost too much. If you've ever lost a parent you know that feeling all to well. Was so proud to see he could do it. Strong man from a strong family.
135 Amen 🙏🌿💐❤️

163 @michaelclayton87 when I was listening to the eulogies and traits like “class act”, “self-control”, & “kindness” were describing 41, I couldn’t help but to chuckle at what was going through 45s head about what would be said about him 😂
164 #we_want_regime_change_in_iran Viva prince #rezapahlavi
165 🙏🏼
166 Hilary about to fall over any second.
167 Even though President Donald Trump is considered a hero to many American evangelical Christians, he couldn’t bring himself to join his fellow living American presidents to recite the Apostles’ Creed at former President George H.W. Bush’s funeral.A video posted by CNN’s Keith Boykin shows that Trump stood in stone silence even as the former presidents seated near him read off the Apostles’ Creed.In addition to former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former Vice President Al Gore can also be seen reading from the text of the prayer during the service.“This is your ‘Christian’ evangelical president,”
168 A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO A WONDERFUL MAN. ❤
169 @bawbeakari you should free yourself of these delusions you have kiddo.

195 Photos don't lie. The #obamas insincerity and lack of respect are evident.
196 @imlike87 he will probably lay in state in his library and not in D.C. Can you imagine all of the money you could launder through a Presidential Library?

299 @frankotattostudio porque en lugar de pedir ayuda de sacarlos de su país, luchan por derrocar ese dictador comunista que tienen? Trump solo vería la opción de ayudarlos militarmente para una revolución en contra del gobierno de Maduro, que lo único que ha dejado es hambre y destrucción, aunque no lo creas esa ideología comunista es muy popular aquí en EEUU representado por el partido izquierdista o DemocRATA. Piensen en como luchar para recuperar su patria de las garras del comunismo y en vez de huir, llenense de valor y armas para acabar con ese gobierno corrupto.

587 @grammymjp I wasn’t old enough to vote in his first term and I voted for Ronald Regan in his second run for office, but I have a lot of respect for both of them for attending President Bush Sr memorial services, like you said at their age it could of not been easy to attend. I also have to mention Bob Dole insisting to stand at President Bush casket, they truly are of the greatest generation.
588 i cried
589 Thank you for all PARTIES for being respectful. GOD BLESS "OUR" AMERICA.

611 C qui?
612 Barry and Michelle look bored and hate being there along with Bubba and Hillary. So disrespectful😪
613 I am choosing to put politics aside here as we all should! What an honor it must be to carry the casket of a former President! I wonder how these various military members were chosen? They look so honorable and professional... now that is a story for the grandchildren ❤️
614 Really sad to see the USA so divided, And making jokes of both sides when someone has passed away.. Really sad... R.I.P. Mr.Bush... And prayers going out to the family...
615 Michelle Obama truly digsuested me.
616 Cool photo!

632 @bawbeakari you have no respect Trump was full of class and respect I didn’t see him throwing shade today when he sat down beside the past criminals of our nation the Obamas and the Clintons
633 I just want to hold onto the thought that after the cerimony, Trump, the Obama's and Clinton's will stand around with a drink just talking and getting along... well.. we can dream..

679 @codyogden66 dude, i posted the video. It doesn't matter which network you choose to watch it on, IT HAPPENED
680 Oh, I bet that was hard for hilary
681 @bawbeakari mentally deranged Libtard!!!
682 Just for the record Sir, as a Soldier myself, you Mr President are our leader. You above most would've had the right to salute the same as I do you.
683 @rbizzle703 embarrassed, the big victory that wasn’t to be! Complete humiliation to lose against President Trump of all people she’s thinking. Trump MAGA 2020 🇺🇸
684 God protect our nation and bless our President's past and the one present. ❤️
685 @pegmanzer proove it. 15 woman also accused trump of the same thing in 2016. And you Right Wingers all brushed it aside. Even when he was caught on tape. At some point your going to take one woman seriously.
686 Such a beautiful, touching funeral 💕🇺🇸
687 #we_want_regime_change_in_iran
688 A good man, a true hero, a good celebration of his life and I know he will be missed. The music and singing was beautiful. 🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸
689 Clinton brought Hill with him - even in church she cant be respectful in church. She sat there like everyone should come and talk to her. Doesnt even acknowledge Melania. Just sat there nodding. Pathetic.
690 Interesting that President and Mrs. Carter didn’t have their hands over their hearts.
691 One love brings peace and happiness
692 🇺🇸❤️😊👍
693 R I P 41 President George h.w Bush
694 Very proud of being American. My prayers are for President Trump and President Bush to become good friends. They both have such great qualities that could help us.
695 @3ku111 Paula jones had to be paid a 850,000 fine from clinton. Search for that one 😂 sheep
696 @pegmanzer sorry he is not my president and don’t bother telling me to leave the country.....ha... I left you country 32 years ago
697 Look at Hillary’s smug face... HAHA!
698 4 Presidents and a complete douchebag head is an organized crime family. Lock up all the Trumps
699 I bet it's killing Obummer to show respect for an American who he detest

754 I wish everyone had such respect for our flag and our country all the time.
755 It was a beautiful service. He’ll go down as one of our best Presidents.

819 @stringsmom calling President Bush an Angel I could not agree more , but why you would defend the Clintons is a mystery to me . Look at what those two animals did to Monica Lewinsky than tell me who should be ashamed. Give me a break.. Merry Christmas 🎄

829 RIP PRESIDENT BUSCH 🇺🇸🇺🇸
830 @jjj.desimone She is not evil and she is no more a liar than any other politician, and she and Pres. Clinton are not “animals.” She’s been vilified ever since her husband ran for office in Arkansas because she is a very smart and strong woman and Americans aren’t ready for that. Bye now!
831 @china_number__1 Thank You have a nice day
832 Does anyone love abortions ?
833 @china_number__1 Are
834 @china_number__1 we
835 @alphaeagle1776 You’re delusional. Trump is the worst president in American history. He is so corrupt and such a liar he makes Nixon look like a saint. But go ahead, keep your head in your tribal sand.
836 @china_number__1 ??????
837 @china_number__1 I love trolls
838 @noelime0324 instead of putting religion and "a good day" with some correct responding, because no day is good when a death or natural disaster happens. Hope your day is pleasant in some aspect at least, see ya👍

849 Fraud.
850 proud of you Mr President 🇺🇸🇺🇸
851 @stringsmom she is not as smart as you thing ... if she was she would have dropped the rapist. Thank God America is and will never be ready for the enabler.
852 Those clowns f’d up this photo. #MAGA
853 @jjj.desimone He is not a rapist. And she is smarter than most. Fact. America would’ve been better off than we are with the corrupt abomination currently in the WH. Bye now!

866 Look at Jimmy Carter, no hand on his heart!😡
867 Rest in peace Mr President 🇺🇸. The world lost a great man and leader. You will walk in the halls of History with the great leaders of the past. Washington, Kennedy, Lincoln, Chruchill, Mandela... our prayers are with our American cousins. As they always are. 🇬🇧

871 Rip gorgie bush ‘41
872 Sign the farm bill!
873 The contrast between presidents is remarkable
874 @stringsmom I don’t know who you are and I wish all your dreams come true. Hopping Santa 🎅 will bring you a basket full of illegals, drug Traffickers , transgenders role models for your kids , and keep calling Trump supporters deplorables . Is that the American Dream?
875 @bobby_baccooon the Bush’s love the Obamas and don’t like the Trumps. So how does that make sense?
876 Total class Mr. President and our Beautiful First Lady; Melania ... God Bless 🙏🇺🇸
877 @stringsmom ok so if u say this that means you’re most likely a democrat or support the democratic party. Your party over the last 200 years has been the problem. The democratic party supported slavery and jim crow laws, wanted the trail of tears, started the Ku Klux klan and still runs it today if u didn’t know, started planned parenthood in the early 1900 that was founded my and avid racist and member of the Ku Klux Klan to eradicate blacks(if u don’t believe me, look her up her name is Margret Sanger, look at her quotes and also Hillary Clinton openly said she supported her) and for the last 200 years republicans have done nothing but fight racism and bigotry and yet u have the audacity to sit at your phone or computer or whatever and openly criticize the president for doing good while your party has 200 years of evil on your side, before you write something, so your research who actually bad.
878 donald trump didnt sing one hymn, not one word, didnt participate in any prayers or congregation activity. What a charlatan Christian.
879 Release the JFK files Don! WWG1WGA
880 @mia.beckman dammmmmn smoked Em lol follow me 😂
881 @bobby_baccooon SO RIGHT🤦🏾‍♂️
882 you arrest a Chinese illegally
883 @myhippieplace12345 racist? racist? have u met your party? done any research? your party started the KKK and continues to run it now, wanted slavery and supported and started Jim Crow laws and segregation. Wanted the trail of tears while the republican party fought for 200 years for everyone’s rights while your party that you continue to turn a blind eye to. Your party and the people who support it started Planned Parenthood to eradicate the blacks, which is a quote said by the founder of planned parenthood, look it up. So u continue to lie for your party when you are the racists and the only reason the blacks moved to the democratic party was in the 1930’s for economic reasons and they did so reluctantly because your party was still openly racist... so go do your research before you call the only party who has ever not been racist
884 @taegonx what does that have to do with them ruining the beautiful picture of our Fantastic 45th and his Gorgeous wife
885 Your The Best President Ever! 🔥❤️🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸#WWG1WGA
886 @bobby_baccooon because chances are if it came between who the Bush’s wanted at the funeral the Obama’s would be their one and only choice not Trump and not Clinton either 😂
887 از برکات ایشان (حضرت ترامپ صلوات الاهورامزدا علیه) و تلاشهای شاهنشاه رضا است که پارسیان را از یوق ۱۴۰۰ ساله اسلامی آزادی خواهند یافت

890 @zacharybarber12 now is not a time for hate
891 Obama was there o my gosh
892 🙏🇺🇸
893 @william_connors33 then why do you follow Trump like c'mon
894 **please edit post. ‘Flag-draped casket of former US President George H.W. Bush’ should be #41 NOT #43. George W. Bush #43 is across the aisle from #45. @realdonaldtrump - your social media team is not doing you any favors. 🇺🇸 Great picture though, ♥️ this country.
895 And Hillary
896 @Zach charybarber12 Cause he’s the POTUS
897 Beautiful funeral and everyone looked very respectful! Such a great country we live in! GBA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

899 Thank god this Funeral was not a ten part Netflix Mini series like McCain's was! And someone tell Hillary to leave the next time she has a coughing jag...
900 @3ku111 omg no offense but are u stupid your party is so corrupt and evil. your party supported slavery and jim crow laws and segregation. wanted the trail of tears while the republicans fought it, so many more. honestly if you want me to list them i will. Your party and Hillary Clinton support planned parenthood and the founder Margaret Sanger who was apart of the KKK(which your party also started) and she said the reason she started planned parenthood was to eradicate the blacks which is also still funny bc most planned parenthoods are found in black communities. You are hypocrites and liars and scams. Or you just don’t do your research. And honestly if you support all that stuff after i told you that stuff you have no right to preach about who’s right and who’s wrong and who’s evil and who isn’t, bc you have 200 years of evil on your side and there’s no way to cover that up, i’d like to see u try

911 Don’t see any spoiled kids taking a knee on this one
912 So sorry Mr. Trump you had to go through all that sitting next to them terrible people 🤮 Just wash your hands with lots of soap
913 I appreciate the respect the people in this photo are paying regardless of their different options. I wish so many American Radicals could be equally respectful of people with different views
914 I wonder how difficult it was for the Obamas and Clintons to stand with their hand over their heart. It goes against everything thier party "stands" for.
915 Congratulation Mr.Trump!!!🌟❤💙The life pass fast. Sr.Bush and Barbara , in returne the Eternidad 😉⭐🌈
916 Hateful comments not welcome

919 @flux_turtlekeeper13 lol! Mind your business, women get abortion for many reasons, plus abortion is a human right, a fetus don’t count, why not foster children that are in the system. While people like you worry about a fetus, when kids are been shot at school.

948 @lilronnie528 the Obama’s hates America,while the Bush family loves America and that’s why it became obvious. The insincerity and lack of respect are evident
949 It would be so funny to play Benny Hill theme song to George Bush being carried out in his coffin.

1035 HELLO it’s 2018. Whatever got us to this point is the past way way past....this is the present which is where I live in the present. You should do the same. You must still be in high school. You’ll see what the future brings !!!! Berate me all you like but I just want a good future for my 8 grandkids most of which are around your age.
1036 George H. W. Bush was one of the most respected and respectable presidents we've had. Goodbye to a great American and a true patriot. Thank you for your service. Rest In Peace. 🇺🇸

1043 @bobby_baccooon I personally despise the obamas and Clinton’s but I don’t think it’s important whether or not they’re in the photo cause at the end of the day we’re mourning the loss of a former president

1096 @alphaeagle1776 President Trump doesn't need any of them.
1097 😍
1098 @bawbeakari maybe to go visit Hillary hahaha.
1099 RIP 41
1100 @sanw64 Donald Trump has the authority to lock her up. Have you yet to realize he fooled you with that one? You still think two years later he plans to lock her up? Or have you come to the realization that you are a simpleton
1101 As the family say goodbye. My thoughts are with them.
1102 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️
1103 Yes! History captured today!🇺🇸
1104 @stringsmom you are so wrong there corruption is Obama's and Hillary you look in the dictionary corruption their picture will come out.
1105 Hilary looks so unhappy, lol
1106 @witchywoman_1963 I would have never recognized her, she definitely hasn’t aged well...Thank you for the information 😉
1107 MR. PRESIDENT YOU DESERVED A BETTER RECEPTION FROM THOSE DEMS, BUT THEY WOULD LOOK BAD. KEEP ON ROCKING!!!! WE LOVE YOU!!
1108 God bless 🙏

1135 It was a sad day in America, but a good day in America when we were able to see the leaders sitting next to each other not scratching each other’s eyes out. We’re so tired of the arguing and fighting. The American people feel more like the parents of these small children who won’t stop fighting. Don’t you want to grab them up and stick their noses in the corner of the room for an hour or slap their little bottoms and put them to bed with no food?! Is it so much to ask to turn on the television and see or hear positive feedback from the media? I don’t know about you but the negativity has to stop, today should have been a good lesson for everyone.

1270 @alphaeagle1776 as much as I dislike her I don’t believe your comment is appropriate given the circumstances. It’s an honorable thing for them all to pay their respects and setting a respectable public example is something that we should desire to see more of and respect as well.
1271 Hillary looks like she’s upset because she won’t have this kind of funeral for herself, not ever being President and all.
1272 Condolence America
1273 Awesome!! Love, love this!!!😮😮😍😍💪💪🙏🏻🙏🏻
1274 @bawbeakari True. From the display of unity and bipartisanship at Bush 41's funeral to pushing for "Prison Reforms". You got this right.👏👏👏
1275 Mr. President I hate that you.. and your beautiful first lady had to sit next to those two thugs and the two thugs next to them I can't believe they're in the same row as you they don't even deserve to be there they should be in jail
1276 @bawbeakari Oh when he visits Mrs. Clinton you mean. Gotcha
1277 Look how girly Obama and Clinton have their hands over their hearts.

1320 Hi, great man, Donald Trump. I am an Iranian but I have not cooperated with the Islamic regime so far, because it is rejected because of widespread poverty and unemployment and structural corruption. The goal of the Iranian youth is to support Prince Reza Pahlavi and the destruction of the Islamic system.
1321 And two traitors of the nation #clintonsgotogitmo
1322 Wow. So the obamas do know how to put their hands over their heart
1323 WTF are you looking at! Did a pornstar walk by or better yet your daughter! 5 yr old autistic kid with a speech impediment and dyslexia would be a smarter more useful president.
1324 This foto speak a lot ... that you are the first ....don 't let anyone to take what is your President ! Respect for you and your wife ! You are real and not actores wie Obamas ...

1345 Hello my Trump I'm an Iranian young man. Millions of young educated job seekers exist in Iran, corruption is blocked by the government. Our hope in the first world is Prince Reza Pahlavi and the third is God. Get rid of the oppression of the Islamic Republic as soon as possible.

1363 سلام به همه عزیزان .بنده یه راهکاری که بهترین کارشناسان این راهکارو برسی کردند و به این نتیجه رسیدند که برای رهایی از این استبداد و دیکتاتوری راه حلی جز این نیست که این مزدوران از هر چیزی پیروی کردند ما از آن روگردان باشیم .مثلا هر سخنی یا هر عملی که گفتند ما آن را انجام ندهیم و از دین و مذهبی که انها دارند ما فاصله بگیریم.در اینجا لازم به ذکر است که بگویم هیچ انسانی بخاطر دین و مذهبش رتبه و مرتبه بالاتری نخواهد گرفت حتی در کوتاهی یا بلندی عمر و یا بیشتر شدن روزی یا کمتر شدن ان دخیل نخواهد بود ..اگر اینطور بود مردمان چین و روسیه که حتی خدا را قبول ندارند نباید عمر زیاد که چه عرض کنم حتی نباید زنده میماندند ولی ما شاهد این هستیم که انها هم به خوبی زندگی میکنند و هم رفاه و روزیشان از ما مردم ایران بیشتر است.با قدری تفکر همه ما متوجه میشویم که این بهترین راه حل برای رسیدن به آزادی است.

1383 @wuv_true_wuv I was at work and couldn't watch but I went in YouTube. I bawled my eyes out. What a moving such of a son's love for his father. You can see in that family how much they loved him dearly. Alan Simpson speech was incredible too... The friendship they had and look one Democrat and one Republican all her talked about was loyalty and friendship. I must have watched it 3x
1384 @beagle_mom1 ... why doesn’t the peanut farmer President Carter not have his hand on his heart... does he know something we don’t...🤔🤔
1385 @fatimapanahi67 خب عشقه😊
1386 @mybeautifulpoms did you notice the difference in president Bush's funeral and McCain funeral... This is so classy and it was about a great human being they didn't use it as a political bashing...
1387 @paula_jo_davenport and didn't you love Alan Simpson's too!! Cried my eyes out on both... He just made it about his loyalty and love for his friend. Even tho one was Democrat and one was Republican...I was so moved. It reminded me of the speech that 41 gave at president Reagan's funeral... He loved that man.
1388 Really sorry to USA and Mr. President.... My condolence
1389 Donald looking sharp... 1st lady looking beautiful 👍. The Trumps
1390 @juttascarry bawled my eyes out... That was truely moving watching a son's love for his dad.

1403 @sheshesayz I did!!! This was classy and respectful...and a side note..I for one appreciated the respect shown to President Trump for a change!! I'm not sure I could have sat next to the man who had my phones tapped in my own home but as always...elegance and respect were all the Trumps displayed. Truly a remarkable service!! Oddly I can't remember such ado about any other former President when they passed🤔

1419 Amazing picture
1420 A pic is worth a thousand words. And this one speaks volumes.
1421 During the rally, Hillary Clinton's hatred was clear to you clearly. What did you do with President Tramp with these globalists?
1422 God bless him

1435 Whether you agreed with Bush or not, he was civil and had our best interests at heart. Miss those days. Integrity.
1436 @shirleyatorres yes. More beautiful than Obama's wifeb
1437 @susanus57 what did She say
1438 😟✋
1439 @lil_lombardi33 You don’t have to recite the prayer....
1440 The Obamas really walk the walk on the "when they go low, we go high" mantra. Wow. The class and grace of Barack and Michelle to not only sit next to the Trumps but shake their hands after the Birtherism, the lies, the insults, the plagiarism, etc.
1441 Notice President Carter and wife. 👎🏻
1442 @paula_jo_davenport I miss him every day
1443 Hilary sadly looked so bitter during the whole ceremony 🧐
1444 LOL He was invited by the Bushes 6 months ago. They are taking the high road, You should try it. It’s Hillary and the molester Bill that shouldn’t be there !! 😂

1460 @lilronnie528 I can’t figure out why Obummer always has his nose up in the air.
1461 This was a big loss to the U.S. and he will always be remembered as an American Hero, and a great President.
1462 What a joke! They all know he was a traitor.
1463 @poor_america going to church or reciting something doesn't make someone less Christian than anyone else. Stupid snowflake troll.

1472 On the the way to dump.
1473 @sheshesayz Oh yes...it has been an awe moment throughout this entire funeral. His dog lying next to him in mourning too. Just an amazing experience! But it never felt sad to me like most funerals feel...it was a celebration of life and that life moving on to his finial home. It's how the word of God tells us we should act ..mourn as a baby is born and rejoice as a person dies. But we do it completely opposite. I've never been able to do it with my own loved ones.
1474 @_americanita_ Big hugs ...❤️ We get through it day by day. Some good days and some bad but all blessed because we have those memories of our loves. 😊

1477 People who post negative comments are showing their lack of common civility and manners. Where were you raised, in a barn?
1478 👏
1479 It’s nice to see everyone just putting their differences aside for a short period of time to come together to pay respects to another human that has served this country. Period!
1480 God bless all of them.so happy to see our wonderful president and first lady there.
1481 Rest in your Heavenly Father's arms former President George H.W. Bush, where there is peace, joy and no more pain.
1482 @bobby_baccooon "It' always the right time to do the right thing" 😂😂😂 Why do u even support him lol.
1483 @notorious.connorb keyboard warrior.
1484 Tomorrow or 2 weeks. The fact is that they did for what ever amount of time and let the focus be on why they were there in the 1st place. To pay their respects to another human that also served this country.

1488 Could obummer appear any more uninterested with the red of the cronies!
1489 @bobby_baccooon right! I'm glad I'm not the only one that noticed. Bummer seems like he doesn't even want to raise his hand even!
1490 @pattismurphy337 she doesn't need him for her next presidential campaign anyway 😂😂😂😜

1493 President Trump is a class act.

1496 @rbizzle703 its almost like someone just died and she's at their funeral. This is coming from a republican too.
1497 @alcorn.scott but not all Christians are Catholic. Trump can be Christian,,but not,Catholic sonit would be understandable if he didn't read.

1508 Carter does NOT have his hand on his heart. Its in his pockets proving again that the left has no heart.
1509 Four Presidents and one orange Russian agent.
1510 Was Hilary Clinton there because if she was she would Propably leave as soon as possible
1511 Dad, it’s me. Why won’t you answer my calls?
1512 @bawbeakari moronic !
1513 Why didn't the Carter's put their hands over their hearts?
1514 This was sad to watch yesterday I cried at times but he had a beautiful service at the Cathedral. May Former President George H. W. Bush Rest in Peace & may God be with & Bless the rest of his family.

1530 @mrybada when did he start working with the Russians? The day he won?
1531 @amerikajin1969 and that’s what I saw but people on this feed are like poor President sorry you had to sit next to criminals,and lock her up....when will that ever end . I got up at 2 A.M. to watch and pay my respect in some small way...several people said how proud they were of him.... r u kidding me. Is he a little baby.... Yahoo! He set next to some people he hates for a whole hour.... this was about the bush family whom I respect....so stoic with his arms crossed. The Bush Family was kind enough to invite him and they are not full of anger or hate for things he said about the Bushes in the past...that’s all. That poor trump BS. It’s about the bush family and respect.
1532 #president_trump_just_Iran_change_regime
1533 @fancifulmason9 who is inappropriate. People saying sorry mr pres you have to sit next to criminal. I was respecting the Bushes !
1534 American idiots!
1535 Obama and Bill and Hillary should have been arrested on the spot 😡😡😡
1536 George HW Bush was the 41st President not the 43rd

1543 Making a public example of the Clintons, Obamas, etc... would be a good place to start the healing process for our country. The storm is here and those with faith need to assure others that it is part of the plan when the news breaks.

1577 I’m amazed obama and his husband showed up
1578 I’m not upset about the Obama’s or the Clinton’s being in the pic with Trump, because it only shows how despite our history, we can still come to together to celebrate a life, to celebrate the deeds of a fellow American, Rest In Peace Mr. President #41 🇺🇸
